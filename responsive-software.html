        <h1>Responsive Software</h1>
        <p>
            Software has changed a lot since its infancy in the 1950s. However – from early mainframes and monolithic
            architectures to modern unstructured databases and distributed architectures – the fundamental pattern has
            remained the same: moving data to a central location for processing. The technology has changed from
            mainframes to SQL databases to cloud data warehouses & lakehouses, but the core pattern of data
            centralization persists.
        </p>
        <p>
            This doesn't make sense anymore. The volume of data organizations need to store and process is
            ever-increasing, and importantly, we've reached the point where real-time needs begin to balloon. Companies
            on the bleeding edge of technology (e.g. TikTok's <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.07663" target="_blank"
                rel="noopener noreferrer">real-time recommendations</a>, Stripe's <a
                href="https://stripe.com/blog/shepherd-how-stripe-adapted-chronon-to-scale-ml-feature-development"
                target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fraud detection models</a>) also recognize this.
        </p>
        <p>
            AI in particular demands real-time data. While pre-training spurred initial improvements with LLMs,
            post-training reinforcement learning (i.e. like <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12948" target="_blank"
                rel="noopener noreferrer">DeepSeek-R1</a>) will power further advancements. Today, brittle AI agents
            struggle with fluid workflows that demand constant adaptation. In order for them to learn on the fly, AI
            agents need to process & act on new information in real-time.
        </p>
        <p>
            The current improvement loop for AI, with human intervention, is manual and time-consuming. What's become
            abundantly clear to us is that human data should no longer be the gold standard now that models are able to
            self-improve. A more elegant approach would be to merge inference costs with training costs, and simply
            train AI on its own outputs to move towards real-time responsiveness.
        </p>
        <p>
            Right now is an especially exciting time to be working on software, and we think what's being done with
            real-time data (across consumer, fintech, AI, and more) is just the beginning.
        </p>
        <p>
            We're captivated by the concept of a future full of responsive software. Where dynamic traffic lights and
            routing alleviate city congestion. Where daily chores can be automated without manual prompting. Where
            proactive detection of health concerns can save lives.
        </p>
        <p>
            We want to make that future a reality.
